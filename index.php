He usually gets better in each round, but he won't have the same margin for error in this bout.  Starting slow could prove too much to overcome.

	    <p>This match-up is exactly what you'd hope for in a semifinal pairing.  Chris lost by split decision to Mike Kappaz (the defending champ) in last year's semifinals.  Joaquin entered the tournament, by virtue of his number 2 seed, as the biggest threat to a successful Kappaz title defense.  Expect the first 45 seconds to set the tone for the rest of the bout.</p>

    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Mike, the top seed in the lightest bracket, fights like a heavy weight. With a sinister presence in the ring, Kappaz is excellent at controlling and cutting off the ring, despite not throwing a high volume of punches. However, when he does throw, he makes the punches count. Kappaz is the defending champion, and enters the ring with a lot of confidence. He enters this fight after a blistering referee stopped contest in his last bout. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> As an almost entirely front footed fighter, Kappaz is at his best when he is controlling the ring and throwing vicious combinations. Fighting an opponent with a few inches of reach on him, Mike could get in trouble if he is unable to get inside North's long jab. Mike will have to take the fight on the inside where his combinations will be most effective. </p>

	    		 <p class="descrip-text"><strong>Experience:</strong> Novice</p>
    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Riley will undoubtedly be taller than everyone he could fight in the tournament, and his reach will be his greatest asset. North is coming off of his first ever fight in the bouts, in which he effectively handled a scrappy Troy Nguyen. In his last fight, North's opponent sought to take the fight to his body and brawl in the corners. Riley was able to demonstrate some ring moxie by calmly keeping his opponent at range by using his strong jab and right cross. He'll need to do the same in this upcoming bout. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>North will need to effectively move laterally to avoid being pinned in a corner by Kappaz. By pumping his jab and straight right, North can disrupt Kappaz' rhythm and combinations. North has not faced an opponent the caliber of Kappaz yet and his will to win will certainly be tested. If North can remain calm and display the same ring savvy he displayed in the Quarterfinals and keep Kappaz at bay, North has a great shot of getting his hand raised. </p>

	    <p>Where this fight takes place within the ring is a great indicator of who will win the bout. If most of the fighting occurs in the middle of the ring where North can use his reach and disrupt Kappaz' timing, North has a great shot of getting his hand raised and moving onto the finals. If the stalwart Kappaz can apply pressure and pin North against the ropes, he has an excellent chance of getting a shot at a repeat title. Both fighters' conditioning will be tested unlike it has been in their previous fights. </p>

The only opponents who have given Alex, the #1 seed and two-time defending champ, trouble in the past are ones who have fought coming forward, leaned on him, and turned the boxing match into more of a wrestling match.  That's not Dom's style.  Dom, to his credit, though, has spent as much time in the gym training as nearly anybody in the program.

    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Joey will occasionally move in unorthodox ways, which often keeps his opponents off balance.  In no small part to his martial arts background, his composure and discipline in the ring are undeniable assets.  A thoughtful boxer, Joey will often look to set up his punches more than most competitors.  When he throws multiple punch combinations, boxers have to be ready to defend every inch of the scoring area.</p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> Joey's ability to control distance will be crucial.  If the boxing match turns into a wrestling match, his odds of winning decrease.  On the other hand, if he's able to use his lateral movement and sharp combination punching to score in bunches, Joey's chances of advancing to the finals are high.</p>

	    <p>This matchup has a lot of fun storylines.  Joey, a junior captain who visited Bangladesh this summer, is trying to extend his streak of advancing one round farther than the previous year.  He also is one of two fighters in this year's tournament who has a brother-sister duo working his corner during the bouts, which is likely a first in Bengal Bouts history.  Greg, who is studying at Notre Dame for a year as part of an exchange program, has been making the most of his one year to compete.  Both boxers feel a sense of urgency for this bout.  It should be an entertaining one!</p>

    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Garrett, quite simply, is one of the most skillful boxers in the entire program. He is able to fight much bigger than his size. He is able to move effectively using his head movement and striking precision to close the distance on his opponents and work both levels. Because of this, Garrett is able to control the center of the ring and force his opponents to move as he waits on a counter. Arguably his greatest strength is his ability to close the distance and use his precise timing inside to score quickly and effectively. Schmelling's ring generalship, gained from his extensive experience, is another key strength of his, and one that he will have to utilize in this bout in order to get his hand raised. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> Schmelling is coming off a dominating performance in the quarterfinals in which his bout got stopped early. He has yet to have an opponent this year push him deep into a fight, and therefore his conditioning has yet to be tested. If Garrett can control the pace of the fight and can keep up with the high punch output by Gio, he has an excellent chance of getting his hand raised and returning to the finals. </p>

    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Gio's conditioning, will to win, and scrappiness are undoubtedly his greatest assets. Gio has fought two very differing opponents thus far in bouts - first a tall, lengthy counterpunching lefty, followed by a scrappy high volume puncher, in which he convincingly handled both of them, including an upset unanimous victory against the #4 seed Alex Cervantez in the quarterfinals. However, in order to get his hand raised on Monday, Gio will have to tighten up his punches and land crisper combinations than he did against Cervantez. His impressive conditioning will be tested, and if he can keep the fight close going into the third round, he can use it to out will his opponent and make up some lost ground en route to a victory. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>The first minute of this fight will be a huge indicator of how the fight will go. If Gio can hang tight and not get immediately out classed by the savvy Schmelling, his grittiness and will to win will begin to take over the fight. If the fight is close going into the third round, Lincon has a great shot to win the bout in the third round when his opponent's guard will be deteriorating due to fatigue. Despite lacking a ton of experience, Gio is too skilled to ever be counted out of a fight, and could easily give Schmelling fits on Monday. </p>

These are the questions that will decide the fight. If Gio can hang in the fight until the later stages where he can use his conditioning to make up lost ground, he has a great shot of advancing to the finals. However, if he is sloppy, Schmelling will make him pay. If Garrett controls the pace of the fight and gets in a rhythm, the top seed will be making his way back to the finals.

    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Paddy, AKA the human energizer bunny, is almost undoubtedly the best conditioned fighter in the club. With such a high motor, he has on multiple occasions beaten more skilled fighters simply by throwing more punches than them. This is assuredly his greatest strength, as he demonstrated last year in the tournament where he had without question the toughest path to a championship, beating 3 extremely talented fighters. However, he had a productive off season training his boxing skills in Chicago, and it has paid big dividends. Now a boxer first, Paddy relies on his brawling as his ace in the hole, and its a brutally effective one. If Paddy can put his opponents in a corner, its going to be a long night for them. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> Paddy often struggles against opponents with a significantly longer reach than him - such is the case against his opponent, Sean Flynn. If Paddy can avoid being jabbed excessively throughout the fight and take the fight inside and put Flynn in the corner, Lawler will have an excellent chance to use his high punch volume and experience to earn his way back to the finals. </p>

	    		 <p class="descrip-text"><strong>Experience:</strong> Novice</p>
    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Sean Flynn comes into this fight as a much taller and longer fighter, which will be his greatest strength in this upcoming bout. Flynn will have to pump his jab as a machine gun to deter Paddy from coming inside on him. Flynn, despite being a novice, demonstrated some ring savvy in his win in the quarterfinals against Seamus Long. He will have to continue this trend and not panic when Paddy flips the switch and begins charging in with reckless abandon. If Sean can use his footwork and move laterally while continuing to throw on the move, he can disrupt Paddy's rhythm and frustrate him, which causes Lawler's form to decay and leave him more vulnerable. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>Lookout for Sean's straight punches. A common combo, no doubt, but Sean used his 1-2 effectively against Seamus Long and these will be the key to his success against Lawler. When Paddy bull rushes in, Flynn can seize the opportunity by pumping uppercuts while Lawler's is bowed. Sean will have to avoid the corners like the plague, control the center of the ring, utilize his reach, and not get out thrown by Paddy in order to ensure his hand getting raised en route to the finals. </p>

	    <p>Like other fights in the tournament, this is a classic inside vs outside fighter bout. If most of the action takes place in the center of the ring, Flynn's reach will be extremely effective in throwing off Lawler's timing and rhythm. However, if Lawler can assert his will and pin Flynn in the corner, Sean might be hitting the showers early. Sean has no doubt proved he is a tougher fighter than his experience gives him credit for, and he won't be an easy out. This is a classic bull & matador fight, and should be entertaining to watch. </p>

    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>One of the four Keough fighters left in the tournament, Danny, a novice, has stormed through his bracket, looking extremely impressive doing so. In his last fight, Danny upset a tough #3 seed in Charlie Puntillo. Despite being a novice, Danny appeared extremely calm and composed in his quarterfinal bout. His composure will surely be tested in this upcoming bout, however. Danny's strength is his combination punching. Training at a family gym during the breaks, Danny has learned the basics very well, and is proof that you don't have to be a veteran to succeed in the tournament if you are willing to work hard and commit yourself to the sport. Danny's hard work has paid off, and when he lets his hands go, watch out. Danny is a natural athlete and competitor, and he certainly will not be an easy out for anyone in the tournament. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> If Danny can keep the fight close throughout the first round, his natural competitive instincts and will to win will begin to take over the fight. Undoubtedly an underdog (as he was in his last fight as well), the first round will be crucial for his confidence. If he can remain composed, control the outside positioning to negate McDermott's big left, and let his hands go, Danny has a great shot of scoring another big upset and moving on to the finals. </p>

Jack is looking to finish what he started last year, but first he will have to go through Danny, a surprisingly tough novice who will not be an easy victory. McDermott has bulked up since his bouts last year, and the power shows. A tall lefty, many struggle with the southpaw's smooth punching and much improved foot work. McDermott is able to string together combinations seamlessly, something that often gives his opponents trouble, compounding with all of his punches coming from the opposite angles that people are used to. McDermott is a young star of the program, and he looks to prove why on Monday night. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>After jumping up almost 20 pounds from his weight last year, McDermott makes it look like the transition has been easy. However, he's yet to fight someone that can test if he can handle the increase in power. If McDermott gets in his groove and capitalizes on his opponents lack of experience, he'll find his way back into the finals. To do this, he will need to use his legs to set up his big left hand and string together his combos. </p>

A natural swimmer, his punches slightly resemble that of a freestyle motion, and the overhand motion provides an extra sting on his punches. His bread and butter are his 1-2, and he has mastered them over his four years in the bouts, although his recent development of other punches has paid huge dividends and added some more tools to his already potent arsenal. He has great reach on most of the opponents he will fight, which combines well with his dominating 1-2. Mostly a front footed fighter, Jack never stops coming forward. What he may lack in grace, he more than makes up for in toughness and conditioning. Anyone finding themselves in the same ring as Jack better be up for a dog fight. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> Look for Jack to set the tone early by establishing his powerful and quick 1-2.

He is capable of stringing together great combinations when he wants to, and moves very well. Chris had his toughness tested after winning a close bout against a former football player in the quarterfinals. That toughness will be necessary on Monday in order for Chris to get his hand raised. He will need to use his effective lateral movement and head movement to disrupt Considine's 1-2 combo. Chris has greatly improved his hooks this year, and they were his money maker in his last bout. Those hooks will be very effective in combatting Considine's style in the upcoming bout. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>Look for Chris to use his experience to handle the pressure and make this a close bout. Chris will need to move his head effectively so his opponent does not move it for him.

If Considine gets rolling with his 1-2, he'll be on his way to the 87th Bengal Bouts finals. However, if Chris can make Considine miss and pay off of counter punch opportunities, it will plant some doubt in his mind, enough to throw him off his rhythm so that Chris can capitalize and throw his combinations.

Bode is significantly taller than his opponent, and his reach will undoubtedly be his greatest strength in all of his fights. Another huge advantage is his conditioning - running up and down the court has paid huge dividends. Despite his inexperience, Aaron will be a tough out for anyone in the tournament.

    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Montana, truly a tough fighter, comes into the tournament this year after shocking many by advancing to the finals in the 205 pound weight class last year, where he lost to a skilled opponent. Montana's greatest strength is his ability to simply find a way to win. A ROTC kid, his toughness and grit are characteristics that cannot be overlooked. After spending a good portion of time this season working on his footwork and variety of punches, Montana is a very solid fighter. Montana is at his best when he is applying pressure and stringing together combinations to the head and body. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>While clearly holding the advantage in experience, Giordano is severely lacking in the athleticism and conditioning in comparison to his opponent. To make up for this, Montana will have to take the fight to the inside and slow down the squirrelly Bode by attacking the body.

The defending champion in the 205 pound weight class, Pat has jumped up to the heavyweight class for this tournament.  Not one to rest on his laurels, Pat has invested more "sweat equity" in the boxing gym than any other competitor in the program.  Two years ago, Pat suffered his only Bengal Bouts defeat (a split-decision loss in the finals to Bengal Bouts president Jack Considine) in part because his conditioning was not up to par.  He has since attacked what was once a weakness and made it a strength.  When he lets his hands go, he is as good as it gets.</p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> Pat is widely regarded as the best boxer in the program.  Now it's simply a matter of demonstrating it when the lights shine brightest.  Because of his confidence in fighting backwards and counter-punching, Pat can occasionally get a little lackadaisical instead of asserting himself by coming forward.  When Pat throws punches moving forward, he is nearly unbeatable.  

Also worthwhile to note: No boxer-corner duo have logged as much time throwing mitts as Pat has with his corner.  That type of familiarity can pay dividends in close fights.</p>

Not a high-volume puncher, Erich does a good job managing distance and controlling his output to avoid expending any unnecessary energy.

	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>Erich's go-to punch has been his lead left "slap" hook.

This experience has made him into a salty veteran that hits like a mack truck. For his size, Jackson lives up to his nickname - "The Flash." His wrestling background shines in the ring as he moves well for a heavy weight. An inside fighter by trade, Wrede is used to being shorter than his opponents and looks to take the fight inside to the body. Jackson will do everything in his power to pin his opponent against the ropes, and with good reason. If Wrede gets his opponent against the ropes, it helps negate his reach disadvantage. </p>

One of the lighter heavyweights, he moves fairly well. His main strength is his ability to keep coming forward and disrupting his opponents rhythm and timing. Richelsen's reach on Wrede will be a huge advantage for him in this bout, and he will need to use his 1-2 effectively to disrupt Wrede's timing. After a tough draw in last year's tournament and a loss to an extremely talented fighter, Ryan is here this year to show why he's a talented young star of the program.</p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>This will be Ryan's first real test of the tournament this year, and it will show early if he is ready for it. If he is able to eat Jackson's punches without too much damage, Ryan will out-throw Jackson and be on his way to a trip to the finals.
