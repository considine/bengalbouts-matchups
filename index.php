	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> If Joaquin is able to get his opponent moving backwards for most of the fight, he is exceptionally difficult to beat.  After receiving a bye in the first round, Joaquin won a unanimous decision in the quarters, but he didn't showcase all of his abilities.

	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>The first round will be critical for Chris.  He usually gets better in each round, but he won't have the same margin for error in this bout.  Starting slow could prove too much to overcome.  However, if Chris is able to start fast and control the center of the ring, he has a good chance of getting his hand raised.  </p>

	    <h5 class="center-text">This match-up is exactly what you'd hope for in a semifinal pairing.  Chris lost by split decision to Mike Kappaz (the defending champ) in last year's semifinals.  Joaquin entered the tournament, by virtue of his number 2 seed, as the biggest threat to a successful Kappaz title defense.  Expect the first 45 seconds to set the tone for the rest of the bout.</h5>

    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Mike, the top seed in the lightest bracket, fights like a heavy weight. With a sinister presence in the ring, Kappaz is excellent at controlling and cutting off the ring, despite not throwing a high volume of punches. However, when he does throw, he makes the punches count. Kappaz is the defending champion, and enters the ring with a lot of confidence. He enters this fight after a blistering referee stopped contest in his last bout. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> As an almost entirely front footed fighter, Kappaz is at his best when he is controlling the ring and throwing vicious combinations. Fighting an opponent with a few inches of reach on him, Mike could get in trouble if he is unable to get inside North's long jab. Mike will have to take the fight on the inside where his combinations will be most effective. </p>

	    		 <p class="descrip-text"><strong>Experience:</strong> Novice</p>
    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Riley will undoubtedly be taller than everyone he could fight in the tournament, and his reach will be his greatest asset. North is coming off of his first ever fight in the bouts, in which he effectively handled a scrappy Troy Nguyen. In his last fight, North's opponent sought to take the fight to his body and brawl in the corners. Riley was able to demonstrate some ring moxie by calmly keeping his opponent at range by using his strong jab and right cross. He'll need to do the same in this upcoming bout. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>North will need to effectively move laterally to avoid being pinned in a corner by Kappaz. By pumping his jab and straight right, North can disrupt Kappaz' rhythm and combinations. North has not faced an opponent the caliber of Kappaz yet and his will to win will certainly be tested. If North can remain calm and display the same ring savvy he displayed in the Quarterfinals and keep Kappaz at bay, North has a great shot of getting his hand raised. </p>

	    <h5 class="center-text">Where this fight takes place within the ring is a great indicator of who will win the bout. If most of the fighting occurs in the middle of the ring where North can use his reach and disrupt Kappaz' timing, North has a great shot of getting his hand raised and moving onto the finals. If the stalwart Kappaz can apply pressure and pin North against the ropes, he has an excellent chance of getting a shot at a repeat title. Both fighters' conditioning will be tested unlike it has been in their previous fights. </h5>

His cardio is an undeniable asset, and he has a history of finishing strong in close bouts.</p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> Controlled aggression is the key to Alex's success.  When he is moving forward and picking his shots, he poses lots of challenges for his opponents.  If Alex is able to set a face pace early without getting too wild, he's in line to advance to his third straight finals.</p>

The only opponents who have given Alex, the #1 seed and two-time defending champ, trouble in the past are ones who have fought coming forward, leaned on him, and turned the boxing match into more of a wrestling match.  That's not Dom's style.  Dom, to his credit, though, has spent as much time in the gym training as nearly anybody in the program.

Joe's defensive instincts are excellent, which is critical for a fighter who does not often keep his hands up high to defend.  His athleticism and composure have often carried the day.  Those two traits, combined with a refined boxing game this year, make him a tough out for anybody.</p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>Does Joe throw find success throwing more than just his jab and right cross?

    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Garrett, quite simply, is one of the most skillful boxers in the entire program. He is able to fight much bigger than his size. He is able to move effectively using his head movement and striking precision to close the distance on his opponents and work both levels. Because of this, Garrett is able to control the center of the ring and force his opponents to move as he waits on a counter. Arguably his greatest strength is his ability to close the distance and use his precise timing inside to score quickly and effectively. Schmelling's ring generalship, gained from his extensive experience, is another key strength of his, and one that he will have to utilize in this bout in order to get his hand raised. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> Schmelling is coming off a dominating performance in the quarterfinals in which his bout got stopped early. He has yet to have an opponent this year push him deep into a fight, and therefore his conditioning has yet to be tested. If Garrett can control the pace of the fight and can keep up with the high punch output by Gio, he has an excellent chance of getting his hand raised and returning to the finals. </p>

    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Gio's conditioning, will to win, and scrappiness are undoubtedly his greatest assets. Gio has fought two very differing opponents thus far in bouts - first a tall, lengthy counterpunching lefty, followed by a scrappy high volume puncher, in which he convincingly handled both of them, including an upset unanimous victory against the #4 seed Alex Cervantez in the quarterfinals. However, in order to get his hand raised on Monday, Gio will have to tighten up his punches and land crisper combinations than he did against Cervantez. His impressive conditioning will be tested, and if he can keep the fight close going into the third round, he can use it to out will his opponent and make up some lost ground en route to a victory. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>The first minute of this fight will be a huge indicator of how the fight will go. If Gio can hang tight and not get immediately out classed by the savvy Schmelling, his grittiness and will to win will begin to take over the fight. If the fight is close going into the third round, Lincon has a great shot to win the bout in the third round when his opponent's guard will be deteriorating due to fatigue. Despite lacking a ton of experience, Gio is too skilled to ever be counted out of a fight, and could easily give Schmelling fits on Monday. </p>

	    <h5 class="center-text">How will Garrett handle the pressure of a highly competitive and high volume puncher? How will Gio deal with an opponent who is much more skilled than anyone he has faced thus far? These are the questions that will decide the fight. If Gio can hang in the fight until the later stages where he can use his conditioning to make up lost ground, he has a great shot of advancing to the finals. However, if he is sloppy, Schmelling will make him pay. If Garrett controls the pace of the fight and gets in a rhythm, the top seed will be making his way back to the finals. This will be an entertaining fight until the end. </h5>

	    		 <img class="boxer-photo" alt="blue-boxer" src="img/plawer.jpg"> </img>
	    		 <p class="descrip-text"><strong>Dorm: </strong>Fisher</p>
	    		 <p class="descrip-text"><strong>Experience: </strong>3rd Year</p>
    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Paddy, AKA the human energizer bunny, is almost undoubtedly the best conditioned fighter in the club. With such a high motor, he has on multiple occasions beaten more skilled fighters simply by throwing more punches than them. This is assuredly his greatest strength, as he demonstrated last year in the tournament where he had without question the toughest path to a championship, beating 3 extremely talented fighters. However, he had a productive off season training his boxing skills in Chicago, and it has paid big dividends. Now a boxer first, Paddy relies on his brawling as his ace in the hole, and its a brutally effective one. If Paddy can put his opponents in a corner, its going to be a long night for them. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> Paddy often struggles against opponents with a significantly longer reach than him - such is the case against his opponent, Sean Flynn. If Paddy can avoid being jabbed excessively throughout the fight and take the fight inside and put Flynn in the corner, Lawler will have an excellent chance to use his high punch volume and experience to earn his way back to the finals. </p>

			 	<img class="boxer-photo" alt="blue-boxer" src="img/sflynn.jpg	"> </img>
			 	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Dorm: </strong>Off Campus</p>
	    		 <p class="descrip-text"><strong>Experience:</strong> Novice</p>
    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Sean Flynn comes into this fight as a much taller and longer fighter, which will be his greatest strength in this upcoming bout. Flynn will have to pump his jab as a machine gun to deter Paddy from coming inside on him. Flynn, despite being a novice, demonstrated some ring savvy in his win in the quarterfinals against Seamus Long. He will have to continue this trend and not panic when Paddy flips the switch and begins charging in with reckless abandon. If Sean can use his footwork and move laterally while continuing to throw on the move, he can disrupt Paddy's rhythm and frustrate him, which causes Lawler's form to decay and leave him more vulnerable. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>Lookout for Sean's straight punches. A common combo, no doubt, but Sean used his 1-2 effectively against Seamus Long and these will be the key to his success against Lawler. When Paddy bull rushes in, Flynn can seize the opportunity by pumping uppercuts while Lawler's is bowed. Sean will have to avoid the corners like the plague, control the center of the ring, utilize his reach, and not get out thrown by Paddy in order to ensure his hand getting raised en route to the finals. </p>

	    <h3 class='center-text match-notes-header'> Match Notes: </h3>
	    <h5 class="center-text">Like other fights in the tournament, this is a classic inside vs outside fighter bout. If most of the action takes place in the center of the ring, Flynn's reach will be extremely effective in throwing off Lawler's timing and rhythm. However, if Lawler can assert his will and pin Flynn in the corner, Sean might be hitting the showers early. Sean has no doubt proved he is a tougher fighter than his experience gives him credit for, and he won't be an easy out. This is a classic bull & matador fight, and should be entertaining to watch. </h5>
