	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> If Joaquin is able to get his opponent moving backwards for most of the fight, he is exceptionally difficult to beat.  After receiving a bye in the first round, Joaquin won a unanimous decision in the quarters, but he didn't showcase all of his abilities.  If he's able to throw hooks and uppercuts effectively on Monday night, he will be tough to beat.</p>

	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>The first round will be critical for Chris.  He usually gets better in each round, but he won't have the same margin for error in this bout.  Starting slow could prove too much to overcome.  However, if Chris is able to start fast and control the center of the ring, he has a good chance of getting his hand raised.  </p>

	    <h5 class="center-text">This match-up is exactly what you'd hope for in a semifinal pairing.  Chris lost by split decision to Mike Kappaz (the defending champ) in last year's semifinals.  Joaquin entered the tournament, by virtue of his number 2 seed, as the biggest threat to a successful Kappaz title defense.  Expect the first 45 seconds to set the tone for the rest of the bout.</h5>

	    		 <p class="descrip-text"><strong>Experience: </strong>2nd Year</p>
    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Mike, the top seed in the lightest bracket, fights like a heavy weight. With a sinister presence in the ring, Kappaz is excellent at controlling and cutting off the ring, despite not throwing a high volume of punches. However, when he does throw, he makes the punches count. Kappaz is the defending champion, and enters the ring with a lot of confidence. He enters this fight after a blistering referee stopped contest in his last bout. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> As an almost entirely front footed fighter, Kappaz is at his best when he is controlling the ring and throwing vicious combinations. Fighting an opponent with a few inches of reach on him, Mike could get in trouble if he is unable to get inside North's long jab. Mike will have to take the fight on the inside where his combinations will be most effective. </p>

	    		 <p class="descrip-text"><strong>Experience:</strong> Novice</p>
    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Riley will undoubtedly be taller than everyone he could fight in the tournament, and his reach will be his greatest asset. North is coming off of his first ever fight in the bouts, in which he effectively handled a scrappy Troy Nguyen. In his last fight, North's opponent sought to take the fight to his body and brawl in the corners. Riley was able to demonstrate some ring moxie by calmly keeping his opponent at range by using his strong jab and right cross. He'll need to do the same in this upcoming bout. </p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>North will need to effectively move laterally to avoid being pinned in a corner by Kappaz. By pumping his jab and straight right, North can disrupt Kappaz' rhythm and combinations. North has not faced an opponent the caliber of Kappaz yet and his will to win will certainly be tested. If North can remain calm and display the same ring savvy he displayed in the Quarterfinals and keep Kappaz at bay, North has a great shot of getting his hand raised. </p>

	    <h5 class="center-text">Where this fight takes place within the ring is a great indicator of who will win the bout. If most of the fighting occurs in the middle of the ring where North can use his reach and disrupt Kappaz' timing, North has a great shot of getting his hand raised and moving onto the finals. If the stalwart Kappaz can apply pressure and pin North against the ropes, he has an excellent chance of getting a shot at a repeat title. Both fighters' conditioning will be tested unlike it has been in their previous fights. </h5>

	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>Watch out for Conor's aggression. If he's able to keep the fight on the ropes, it will work to his advantage. He proved this in his last two bouts, the most recent a Referee Stopped Contest. He needs to bring the aggression all three rounds, and weather the inevitable fatigue </p>

His cardio is an undeniable asset, and he has a history of finishing strong in close bouts.</p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> Controlled aggression is the key to Alex's success.  When he is moving forward and picking his shots, he poses lots of challenges for his opponents.  If Alex is able to set a face pace early without getting too wild, he's in line to advance to his third straight finals.</p>

	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>Will Dom be able to keep Alex at Bay with his reach and frustrate him?  Will he be able to force Alex to fight going backwards?  If Dom is able to accomplish both of those goals, he has a real chance of scoring the upset.</p>

The only opponents who have given Alex, the #1 seed and two-time defending champ, trouble in the past are ones who have fought coming forward, leaned on him, and turned the boxing match into more of a wrestling match.  That's not Dom's style.  Dom, to his credit, though, has spent as much time in the gym training as nearly anybody in the program.

Joe's defensive instincts are excellent, which is critical for a fighter who does not often keep his hands up high to defend.  His athleticism and composure have often carried the day.  Those two traits, combined with a refined boxing game this year, make him a tough out for anybody.</p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>Does Joe throw find success throwing more than just his jab and right cross?

    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Hands down his power. Krecek throws hard punches, especially the right straight. He also has an impressive mental and physical toughness.</p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong> Look out for Krecek's ability to throw combinations even while under attack. As a freshman, he made it to the semis where he lost a very close bout to a very tall Jack Shephard. Every match he's had, he's pushed the pace and proven to be a true competitor</p>

	    <h5 class="center-text">This will be a very interesting matchup. Corrigan has the upper seed due to his experience in the program, but these boxers complement each other very well. Krecek will likely be the more physical, and Corrigan the more technical.  Jack needs to endure Krecek's strong punches, and Krecek needs to try to control the movement in the ring.</h5>
