	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>The first round will be critical for Chris.  He usually gets better in each round, but he won't have the same margin for error in this bout.  Starting slow could prove too much to overcome.

His cardio is an undeniable asset, and he has a history of finishing strong in close bouts.</p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> Controlled aggression is the key to Alex's success.

The only opponents who have given Alex, the #1 seed and two-time defending champ, trouble in the past are ones who have fought coming forward, leaned on him, and turned the boxing match into more of a wrestling match.  That's not Dom's style.  Dom, to his credit, though, has spent as much time in the gym training as nearly anybody in the program.

Joe's defensive instincts are excellent, which is critical for a fighter who does not often keep his hands up high to defend.  His athleticism and composure have often carried the day.

    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Joey will occasionally move in unorthodox ways, which often keeps his opponents off balance.  In no small part to his martial arts background, his composure and discipline in the ring are undeniable assets.  A thoughtful boxer, Joey will often look to set up his punches more than most competitors.  When he throws multiple punch combinations, boxers have to be ready to defend every inch of the scoring area.</p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> Joey's ability to control distance will be crucial.  If the boxing match turns into a wrestling match, his odds of winning decrease.  On the other hand, if he's able to use his lateral movement and sharp combination punching to score in bunches, Joey's chances of advancing to the finals are high.</p>

    		  	<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Strength: </strong>Greg is long and powerful.  Most boxers in the program are uncomfortable fighting southpaws, and Greg does a good job of capitalizing on their mistakes.  His straight left hand is his best punch.  If he's able to land that with regularity, his opponents are in for a long night</p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>Will Greg be able to catch Joey with the straight left hand?  The junior from Belgium might not be as polished as some boxers in the program, but he continues to give other boxers fits -- both because of his style and his explosive left hand.  </p>

	    <h5 class="center-text">This matchup has a lot of fun storylines.  Joey, a junior captain who visited Bangladesh this summer, is trying to extend his streak of advancing one round farther than the previous year.  He also is one of two fighters in this year's tournament who has a brother-sister duo working his corner during the bouts, which is likely a first in Bengal Bouts history.  Greg, who is studying at Notre Dame for a year as part of an exchange program, has been making the most of his one year to compete.  Both boxers feel a sense of urgency for this bout.  It should be an entertaining one!</h5>
