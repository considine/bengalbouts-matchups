	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> If Joaquin is able to get his opponent moving backwards for most of the fight, he is exceptionally difficult to beat.  After receiving a bye in the first round, Joaquin won a unanimous decision in the quarters, but he didn't showcase all of his abilities.

	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for: </strong>The first round will be critical for Chris.  He usually gets better in each round, but he won't have the same margin for error in this bout.  Starting slow could prove too much to overcome.  However, if Chris is able to start fast and control the center of the ring, he has a good chance of getting his hand raised.  </p>

What makes him so difficult is that he combines his athleticism with one of the best left hooks in the program.  His cardio is an undeniable asset, and he has a history of finishing strong in close bouts.</p>
	    		<p class="descrip-text"><strong>Lookout for:</strong> Controlled aggression is the key to Alex's success.  When he is moving forward and picking his shots, he poses lots of challenges for his opponents.

The only opponents who have given Alex, the #1 seed and two-time defending champ, trouble in the past are ones who have fought coming forward, leaned on him, and turned the boxing match into more of a wrestling match.  That's not Dom's style.  Dom, to his credit, though, has spent as much time in the gym training as nearly anybody in the program.  Getting off to a quick start will be imperative for the challenger.</h5>

Joe's defensive instincts are excellent, which is critical for a fighter who does not often keep his hands up high to defend.  His athleticism and composure have often carried the day.  Those two traits, combined with a refined boxing game this year, make him a tough out for anybody.</p>
